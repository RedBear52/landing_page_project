# Landing Page Project

# Demo-Explanation
This project starts with a multi-section landing page.
It is the second project in **Udacity's Front End Developer** nanodegree program.
The programmer is then challenged to dynamically add elements and data to the DOM using vanilla javascript.
Additionally, highlighting and other helpful styling is added in order to make the user experience more enjoyable and cohesive.
Ideally, this project accelerates the participant's ability to blend a knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript in common real-world use cases.
